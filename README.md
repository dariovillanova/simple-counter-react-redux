## SIMPLE COUNTER (REACT REDUX)

This project was bootstrapped with create-react-app.

Run `npm install`, `npm run build` and `npm run serve`. The App will run in http://localhost:5000/.

To enable development mode run `npm run dev`. This command runs both API server and development server. If you want to run separately type `npm run serve` and in another terminal `npm start`.
